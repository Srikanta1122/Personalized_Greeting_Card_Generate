Personalized Greeting Card Generate: step-by-step

Libraries Used: 
I have used some python libraries to complete the project , the libraries and what the
libraries does in my project is given below…

• torch: PyTorch library, commonly used for deep learning tasks. In this case, it seems to
be utilized for the Stable Diffusion XL model.

• Diffusers: Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pre-trained diffusion
models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures.

• PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image processing tasks. It's employed for
opening, manipulating, and saving images.

• pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used to read data from an Excel file into
a Data-Frame.

• OS: The Python os module provides a way to interact with the operating system. It's
used here to create directories and handle file operations.

• time: The time module is used for generating a timestamp that's appended to the
generated image filenames.

• rembg (Remove Background): A library for removing the background from images. It
seems to be applied to a personal photo in the project.

• numpy: A library for numerical operations. In this case, it's used to convert images to
arrays for processing.

• gradio: A library , used for generating a interface for the user to give input and take
output.
